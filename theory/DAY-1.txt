to declare a const variable there is only one way
const once declare with a value then it cannot be changed 

2)other ways of declaring a variable is by using 
 - let 
 - var

note- 
we do not use var as there was a  problem in javascript that 
javascript does not konw scope 
var does not follow var as , all the same variables get changes out of scope 


note- we can also occupy space for a variable without writing a datatype


";" this is not necassary


undefined- when we do not assign any value to variable
